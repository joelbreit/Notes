# AWS Notes and Flash Cards

## Notes

Flashcards should work both ways
- Term -> Definition as well as Definition -> Term
- The definition should never use the entire term and should try to avoid using part of the term
- The definition should be concise and specific

## Compute

### Deployment Strategies

**All-at-Once Deployment** - Deployment strategy that immediately updates all existing instances with likely downtime and no fallback

**Rolling Deployment** - Deployment strategy that updates iteratively without adding capacity

**Rolling with Additional Batch Deployment** - Deployment strategy that updates your existing resources iteratively and adds enough resources to maintain capacity

**Immutable Deployment** - Deployment strategy that creates a new environment with your update allowing for testing before you switch and avoiding a mixed environment

**Blue/Green Deployment** - Deployment strategy that creates a new environment with your update then updates the DNS record to point to that new environment

**Canary Deployment** - Deployment strategy that updates some of your application allowing for testing with real traffic before updating everywhere

## VPCs


* The default network ACL allows all in and out traffic
* The final rule for the default ACL disallows all traffic
* The final rule cannot be modified or removed
* You can assign up to five security groups to the instance
* Security groups act at the instance level, not the subnet level
* Subnets have a 1-to-1 relationship with AZs
* Every VPC has a default security group
* Instances in a VPC are automatically assigned to the default security group
* The default VPC security group cannot be deleted
* Subnets have IP address ranges, not a specific IP address
* A public subnet is just a subnet that has been routed to an internet gateway
* A private subnet is just a subnet that has not been routed to an internet gateway
*
