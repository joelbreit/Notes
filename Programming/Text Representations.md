# Text Representations

## Character Sets

1. **Unicode**: *A universal character encoding standard that assigns a unique number (code point) to every character in every language, as well as symbols and emojis. It supports over 143,000 characters from multiple writing systems.*

## Text Encodings

1. **ASCII**: *The American Standard Code for Information Interchange is a 7-bit character encoding standard that represents text in computers and other devices. It includes 128 characters, including letters, digits, punctuation marks, and control characters.*
2. **UTF-8**: *A variable-width character encoding used for electronic communication. It can represent every character in the Unicode character set and is backward compatible with ASCII. UTF-8 is widely used on the web and supports a vast range of characters from different languages.*
3. **UTF-16**: *A character encoding capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid character code points in Unicode using one or two 16-bit code units. It is commonly used in environments such as Windows and Java.*
4. **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)**: *A single-byte character encoding that can represent the first 256 Unicode characters. It is commonly used for Western European languages.*
5. **Windows-1252**: *A character encoding of the Latin alphabet, used by default in the legacy components of Microsoft Windows in English and some other Western languages.*
