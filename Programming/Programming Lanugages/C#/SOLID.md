# SOLID Principles in C#

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: "A class should have only one reason to change. Each module or class should focus on one task."
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: "Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. Add new features by adding new code, not changing existing code."
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: "Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting program correctness."
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: "Many specific interfaces beat one general-purpose interface. Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones."
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: "High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."
6. **5 Principles of SOLID**: SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP
7. **Pain Driven Development (PDD)**: principle of prioritizing solving real problems and pain points in the system over premature optimization
8. **"New is Glue"**: aphorism emphasizing that instantiating objects creates tight coupling; prefer dependency injection instead
