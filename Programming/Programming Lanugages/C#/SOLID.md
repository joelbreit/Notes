# SOLID Principles in C#

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: a class should have only one reason to change, i.e. only have one job or responsibility
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: *Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.*
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: *Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.*
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: *High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.*
6. **5 Principles of SOLID**: *SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP*
7. **Pain Driven Development (PDD)**: *Focus on solving real problems and pain points in the system rather than optimizing prematurely.*
