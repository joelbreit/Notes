stemming,removing prefixes and suffixes of words for simplification
sentence segmentation,"breaking up a text into individual sentences, using cues like periods or exclamation points"
regular expressions,a language for specifying text search strings
corpus,the entirety of a collection of text
anchors,"special characters in a regular expression for specifying particular places such as `^` and `$` for the beginning and end of a line, respectively"
disjunction,"regex operator for specifying alternatives, using `|` to separate them"
greedy matching,regex matching that tries to match as much as possible

register,a numbered list of capture groups in a regex pattern
non-capturing group,a group in a regex pattern that is not stored in a register e.g. `(?:pattern)`
lookahead assertion,a regex operator for matching a pattern only if it is followed by another pattern e.g. `(?=pattern)`
zero-width assertion,a regex operator for matching a pattern without consuming any characters
negative lookahead assertion,a regex operator for matching a pattern only if it is not followed by another pattern e.g. `(?!pattern)`

word normalization,the task of reducing words/tokens to a standard format
case folding,converting all text to lowercase
lemmatization,"the task of determining that two words have the same root (the words am, are, and is have the shared lemma be)"
