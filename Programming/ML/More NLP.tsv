the distributional hypothesis	idea that words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings
word sense	a particular meaning of a word in a specific context
polysemous	words with multiple word senses like "bank" or "bat"
principle of contrast	idea that no two words have exactly the same meaning
lexical semantics	the linguistic study of word meaning
semantic field	a set of words related by topic (or semantic domain)
hypernymy	the relationship between words where one word is more general than another ("is a" relationship)
meronymy	the relationship between words where one word is a part of another (part-whole relationship)
semantic frame	a set of words that denote aspects of a particular type of event like a commercial transaction
connotation	the affective (emotional or cultural) association of a word
valence dimension	the positive or negative emotional charge of a word
arousal dimension	the intensity of the emotional charge of a word
dominance dimension	the degree of control or power associated with a word
representation learning	ML technique where the system automatically discovers the features or representations needed for a task from the raw data instead of manually crafting features
feature engineering	ML process that uses domain knowledge to identify the most relevant aspects of the data
vector semantics	NLP method of representing word meanings as vectors of numbers in a high-dimensional space
embeddings	representations of discrete data, like words, as continuous vectors that capture semantic meaning
static embeddings	word embeddings represented by a single fixed vector, regardless of the context in which the word appears
contexual embeddings	advanced embeddings that generate different vectors for a word depending on its context
sparse vector	a vector with mostly zero values
dense vector	a vector with many non-zero values
similarity metric	a measure of how alike two vectors are
vector magnitude	the length of a vector, calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of its values
dot product/inner product	the sum of the products of the corresponding elements of two vectors
parallel/collinear vectors	vectors that point in the same direction or lie on the same line
cosine metric	a vector similarity metric that ignores vector magnitude that measures the angle between them (1 when they point in the same direction (colinear), -1 when they point in opposite directions (negatively parallel), 0 when they are orthogonal)
formula for cosine of vectors	(v1 â€¢ v2) / (|v1| * |v2|)
tf-idf (term frequency - inverse document frequency) weighting	a simple method for weighting the importance of words in a document based on their frequency in the document and their rarity in the corpus
formula for idf of a term	log(10) (number of documents in the collection / number of documents containing the term)
formula for tf-idf	tf * idf ()
pointwise mutual information	a measure of how much more likely two words are to co-occur than if they were independent
centroid	the multidimensional version of the mean - the single vector that has the minimum sum of squared distances to each vector in a set
