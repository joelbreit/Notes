# Notes and Flashcards

I keep this repository for notes on all kinds of technical things I am learning because keeping track of them in a git repo makes tracking things easy and is good practice. It also allows me to sync markdown files which in combination with VSCode and Copilot are one of the best ways to take notes and learn new things.
